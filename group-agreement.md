GROUP AGREEMENT

Communication Plan: How will your group communicate with each other? What is your strategy for ensuring everyone's voices are heard, and that contributions from both loud and soft voices are listened to?

-We will allow everyone to elaborate on their ideas. We will not instantly dismiss a new idea without hearing the fully fleshed out description and relevance.

-Engage each other when discussing planning and implementation or progress in an effort to make sure that everyone is caught up and on the same page.

-In our standups, we should check in each day and let our teammates know ahead of time where we are emotionally or physically(tired, sick, etc.) in an effort to keep communication open and positive.

Conflict plan: What will your group do when it encounters conflict? What will your process be to resolve it?

- In the event of a conflict of idea, each party will be allowed to present their solution and the group will discuss and vote on which direction should be taken. If the result is not satisfactory to all parties, a TA may be brought in to arbitrate.

Work plan: How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general? In particular, make sure you know how you'll track whether everyone is contributing equally to the C#, MVC Core Framework, CSS, and HTML portions, and that each person is working on "meaty" problems.

- We will be using Visual Studio Online to create, manage, and assign tasks to different group members.
-Our tasks will be assigned based on who volunteers for each assignment. In the case where no one volunteers, we will assign tasks impartially. Each individual is responsible for ensuring they participate meaningfully at each level of the project.
-We will divvy up the front end and the back end tasks fairly and evenly.
-We will allow weekend work but absolutely no merges over the weekend or overnight.
- We will be here at 9am each day and we will leave at a time that the team agrees (no earlier than 5pm).
- During the day, we will all work at the same table, allowing for easy communication and pair/mob programming.

Git process: What is your Git flow? How many people must review a PR? Who merges PRs?

- PRs will be reviewed and approved by the whole group before merging. All work will stop for a merge party until the PR is merged.

Anything else you feel is important: expectations around work times, stand-up times, taking breaks/seeking help when you're stuck, etc.

-We will experiment with mob programming for the stickier / more difficult tasks.
-We will take breaks when we need them. Itâ€™s good to get up and walk away at times.
