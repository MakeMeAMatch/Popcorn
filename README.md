Project Topic
------
There are so many apps for making connections but one demographic that we found to be underrepresented online are stay-at-home dads. We want to give SAH Dads
more opportunties to meet and form tight-knit communities of their own.

Project Pitch
------
In an age where technology pervades all aspects of our busy everyday lives, both our romantic and platonic relationships are started online. SAH Parents cannot rely
on the workplace as a source of potential friendships. That's where we come in. We are providing SAH Dads with the chance to expand their friend groups and, in so doing,
better their lives.
