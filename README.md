#project topic
There are so many apps for making connections but one demographic that we found to be underrepresented online are stay-at-home dads. We want to give SAH Dads
more opportunties to meet and form tight-knit communities of their own.

#project pitch
In an age where technology pervades all aspects of our busy everyday lives, both our romantic and platonic relationships are started online. SAH Parents cannot rely
on the workplace as a source of potential friendships. That's where we come in. We are providing SAH Dads with the chance to expand their friend groups and, in so doing,
bettering their lives.
